# Design system with custom React components library

This is a React-Typescript and SCSS design system designed to be used to rapidly scaffold websites and web applications. It provides a set of reusable components loosely based on the atomic design principle, which can then be built into modules. These are then used to construct templates and pages in those platforms. It is designed to be platform agnostic and provide the foundation for any web application or website.
